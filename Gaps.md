# Gaps

## UX Gaps

1. **Critical: No Actual Checkout/Payment Flow** 🚨
   - ArtworkDetailPage has a "Buy Now" button that does nothing
   - No cart/checkout UI in the frontend
   - No Paystack integration in the frontend—you have the backend setup but no UI to:
     - Collect buyer information
     - Initialize payment
     - Display payment modal/redirect
     - Handle payment callbacks
     - Show payment status/loading states

2. **No Authentication UI** 🔐
   - You have JWT auth in backend but no login/register forms in frontend
   - No session management (storing/refreshing JWT tokens)
   - No protected routes
   - No user profile pages
   - The DevAuthBanner exists but no actual auth flow

3. **Artist Dashboard Missing** 📊
   - ArtistsPage is just a creation form
   - No view of:
     - Artist's published artworks
     - Sales history
     - Revenue/analytics
     - Artwork status (draft/published/sold)

4. **Admin Console is Placeholder** ⚙️
   - AdminPage has disabled buttons
   - Missing:
     - Order management table
     - Mint queue visibility
     - Failed minting remediation UI
     - User/artist moderation
     - KYC review workflow

5. **No Error Boundaries** 💥
   - React app has no error boundaries for graceful failure handling
   - No global error toast/notification system integration

6. **Missing Loading States** ⏳
   - Some pages have loading states, others don't
   - No skeleton loaders consistently applied
   - No optimistic updates

7. **No Search/Filter UI** 🔍
   - GalleryPage doesn't expose backend filters (type, artist, price range)
   - No sorting options (price, date, popularity)

8. **Buyer Order History** 📦
   - No page for buyers to view their purchases
   - No order tracking/status updates
   - Certificate page is only accessible if you know the orderId

9. **Mobile Responsiveness Unclear** 📱
   - Layout looks decent but needs testing on actual mobile devices
   - Forms might be challenging on small screens

10. **No Email/Notification System** 📧
    - After purchase, users should get email with certificate link
    - Artists should be notified of sales
    - No confirmation emails for registration/orders

## Infrastructure Gaps

1. **No CI/CD Pipeline** 🔄
   - No GitHub Actions workflows
   - No automated testing
   - No deployment automation
   - No environment promotion (dev → staging → prod)

2. **Missing Production Dockerfile** 🐳
   - No Dockerfile for backend
   - No Dockerfile for frontend
   - No docker-compose for full stack deployment
   - Only infrastructure compose (postgres/redis)

3. **No Health Checks/Monitoring** 🏥
   - Backend has @nestjs/terminus installed but not configured
   - No /health or /readiness endpoints
   - No metrics collection (Prometheus)
   - No error tracking (Sentry)
   - No APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
   - No alerting system

4. **No Rate Limiting/Security Middleware** 🛡️
   - No rate limiting on API endpoints (DoS vulnerability)
   - No Helmet.js for security headers
   - No CORS properly configured for production domains
   - No request size limits
   - No file upload size validation beyond code comments

5. **Missing Observability** 📊
   - Logging exists but no structured logging
   - No log aggregation (ELK, Datadog, CloudWatch)
   - No distributed tracing
   - No performance metrics
   - Queue monitoring exists in code but no dashboard

6. **No Backup Strategy** 💾
   - No database backup automation
   - No disaster recovery plan
   - No Redis persistence strategy documented
   - No IPFS pinning redundancy

7. **Secrets Management** 🔑
   - .env files in repo (in .gitignore but risky)
   - No integration with secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc.)
   - Hedera private keys in plain text env vars

8. **No Staging Environment** 🎭
   - Only dev setup documented
   - No staging environment for pre-production testing
   - No environment parity checks

9. **Load Balancing/Scaling** ⚖️
   - Single instance setup
   - No horizontal scaling strategy
   - No CDN configuration for frontend assets
   - Azure storage direct access instead of CDN

10. **Missing Webhook Endpoint** 🪝
    - Paystack webhook handler exists in service but no controller endpoint exposed
    - This means payments can't be verified automatically!
    - Critical for production

11. **No SSL/TLS Configuration** 🔒
    - Development only HTTP
    - No Let's Encrypt setup guide
    - No certificate management

12. **Database Connection Pooling** 🏊
    - Prisma defaults, but no documented connection pool tuning
    - Could cause issues under load

13. **No Job Queue Dashboard** 📋
    - Bull Board or similar not installed
    - Can't monitor queue health visually

14. **No API Documentation** 📚
    - No Swagger/OpenAPI setup
    - Hard for frontend devs to discover endpoints
    - No API versioning strategy

15. **Testing Infrastructure** 🧪
    - Jest configured but no actual tests written
    - No E2E tests beyond manual test scripts
    - No integration tests
    - No contract tests for external APIs (Hedera, Paystack)

16. **No Graceful Shutdown** 🛑
    - App doesn't handle SIGTERM/SIGINT properly
    - Could lose in-flight requests during deployment
    - Queue jobs might not complete

17. **Missing Environment Validation on Startup** ✅
    - Joi validation exists but app might start with missing critical env vars
    - Should fail fast with clear error messages

18. **No Runbook/Incident Response Plan** 📖
    - No documented procedures for:
      - Failed mint recovery
      - Payment disputes
      - Database restore
      - Key rotation

## Priority Recommendations

### Immediate (Week 1)

- Webhook endpoint for Paystack - Can't verify payments without this
- Checkout/payment UI - Complete the user purchase flow
- Basic auth UI - Login/register so users aren't anonymous
- Health checks - For production readiness

### Short-term (Weeks 2-3)

- Rate limiting - Protect against abuse
- CI/CD pipeline - Automate deployments
- Error tracking - Sentry integration
- Admin console - Mint queue and order management

### Medium-term (Month 2)

- Email notifications - Transactional emails
- Monitoring/alerting - Production observability
- Dockerfiles - Container deployment
- Artist/buyer dashboards - Complete UX

### Long-term (Month 3+)

- Staging environment - Pre-prod testing
- Backup automation - Disaster recovery
- Load testing - Performance baseline
- Secondary marketplace - If in roadmap per your docs
