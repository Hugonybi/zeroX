# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system in the zeroX art marketplace platform, with primary focus on buyer and artist roles. The current system has basic role differentiation but lacks comprehensive permission management and resource-level access control. This enhancement will provide granular control over user permissions for core marketplace operations while maintaining a foundation for future admin role expansion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a buyer or artist, I want my access to be controlled by my assigned role and permissions, so that I can only perform actions I'm authorized for within the marketplace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access a protected resource THEN the system SHALL verify the user has the required permission based on their role
2. WHEN a buyer accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL grant permissions for browsing, purchasing, and managing their collection
3. WHEN an artist accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL grant permissions for creating, managing artworks, and viewing sales
4. IF a user tries to perform an unauthorized action THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating insufficient permissions
5. WHEN a user's role is assigned during registration THEN the system SHALL immediately apply appropriate access controls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an artist, I want to control access to my artworks and related data, so that I can manage my creative work and business operations securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an artist creates an artwork THEN the system SHALL automatically grant the artist full management permissions for that artwork
2. WHEN an artist manages their portfolio THEN the system SHALL only allow access to artworks they created
3. WHEN someone attempts to modify an artist's artwork THEN the system SHALL verify they are the artwork owner
4. WHEN an artist views sales data THEN the system SHALL only display orders and analytics for their own artworks
5. IF an artwork is sold THEN the system SHALL maintain artist's view permissions while transferring ownership to the buyer

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a buyer, I want to access my purchased artworks and certificates, so that I can manage my digital and physical art collection securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a buyer completes a purchase THEN the system SHALL automatically grant them ownership permissions for the purchased artwork
2. WHEN a buyer accesses their collection THEN the system SHALL display only artworks they own or have purchased
3. WHEN a buyer views certificate details THEN the system SHALL verify ownership before displaying sensitive blockchain information
4. WHEN a buyer attempts to access artwork details THEN the system SHALL allow full access only for owned artworks and limited preview for others
5. IF a buyer views the marketplace THEN the system SHALL allow browsing all published artworks with appropriate purchase permissions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform user (buyer or artist), I want to see only the actions and features I'm permitted to use, so that the interface is clean and I'm not confused by unavailable options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a buyer views the interface THEN the system SHALL hide all artist-only features like "Create Artwork" or "Manage Portfolio"
2. WHEN an artist views their own artwork THEN the system SHALL hide purchase buttons and show management options instead
3. WHEN users access shared resources like public galleries THEN the system SHALL show only permitted actions for each artwork
4. WHEN role-specific navigation is rendered THEN the system SHALL only display menu items available to the user's role
5. IF a feature requires different permissions THEN the system SHALL conditionally render UI elements based on user capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent permission system for buyer and artist roles, so that new marketplace features can be secured efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new artwork-related features are added THEN the system SHALL apply existing artist permission patterns
2. WHEN new purchase-related features are added THEN the system SHALL apply existing buyer permission patterns  
3. WHEN permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL use a consistent interface across all modules
4. IF performance is critical THEN the system SHALL cache role-based permission checks
5. WHEN debugging access issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear logs of permission decisions for buyer and artist actions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want permission-aware UI components, so that interfaces automatically adapt to user roles without manual permission checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering action buttons THEN the system SHALL automatically hide buttons for actions the user cannot perform
2. WHEN displaying navigation menus THEN the system SHALL filter menu items based on user role permissions
3. WHEN showing data lists THEN the system SHALL only include items the user has permission to view
4. IF a component needs role-specific behavior THEN the system SHALL provide reusable permission-checking utilities
5. WHEN user roles change THEN the system SHALL immediately update the UI to reflect new permission levels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want a seamless experience where I only see relevant features, so that I can focus on actions appropriate to my role without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a buyer logs in THEN the system SHALL display a buyer-focused dashboard with collection, browse, and purchase features
2. WHEN an artist logs in THEN the system SHALL display an artist-focused dashboard with portfolio management and sales analytics
3. WHEN navigating the platform THEN the system SHALL show contextually appropriate actions for each page based on user role
4. IF content requires ownership THEN the system SHALL only display it to users who own the relevant artwork
5. WHEN viewing artwork details THEN the system SHALL show different action sets (buy vs manage) based on user relationship to the artwork

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want resource-level permission controls that work seamlessly with UI rendering, so that users see only the data and actions they're entitled to access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading artwork lists THEN the system SHALL filter results to show only artworks the user has permission to view
2. WHEN displaying artwork details THEN the system SHALL show different information levels based on ownership and role
3. WHEN rendering order history THEN the system SHALL only include orders the user is authorized to see
4. IF a user owns an artwork THEN the system SHALL display ownership-specific features like certificates and transfer options
5. WHEN checking resource permissions THEN the system SHALL efficiently determine access rights for UI rendering decisions
