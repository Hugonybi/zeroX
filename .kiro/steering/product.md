# Product Overview

zeroX is a fiat-first art marketplace that bridges traditional art commerce with blockchain authenticity. The platform enables artists to sell physical and digital artworks using conventional payment methods while automatically generating Hedera NFT certificates for authenticity verification.

## Core Features

- **Fiat-First Commerce**: Artists and buyers transact in traditional currency via Paystack
- **Dual Artwork Types**:
  - **Physical Art**: Real-world assets with RWA (Real World Asset) tokens for ownership
  - **Digital Art**: Native NFTs representing the digital artwork itself
- **Automatic Blockchain Certificates**: Each purchase generates appropriate Hedera tokens
- **Dual Token System**: Separate authenticity tokens (non-transferable) and ownership tokens (transferable)
- **Role-Based Access**: Artists, buyers, and admins with distinct permissions
- **IPFS Metadata Storage**: Artwork metadata stored on IPFS via Pinata
- **Background Processing**: Queue-based token minting with retry mechanisms

## Business Model

The platform removes blockchain complexity from the user experience while providing cryptographic proof of authenticity. Artists focus on creating and selling, buyers purchase with familiar payment methods, and the system handles blockchain operations transparently.

## Target Users

- **Artists**: Create listings, manage sales, view authenticity certificates
- **Buyers**: Browse gallery, purchase artworks, receive ownership certificates
- **Admins**: Oversee platform operations, handle failed minting scenarios
