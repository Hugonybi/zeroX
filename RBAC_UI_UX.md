# RBAC UI/UX Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the frontend with role-based access control UI/UX improvements to provide clear visual feedback about user roles and access permissions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Role-Aware Navigation (Sidebar Component)
**File:** `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`

- Added conditional navigation links based on user role
- Users now only see navigation items they have access to:
  - **Buyers:** See only "Browse"
  - **Artists:** See "Browse" and "Artists"
  - **Admins:** See "Browse", "Artists", and "Admin"
- Matches the behavior of the SiteHeader component

**Before:** All users saw all navigation links (Browse, Artists, Admin) regardless of role
**After:** Navigation is filtered based on authenticated user's role

### 2. Visual Role Indicators (SiteHeader)
**File:** `src/components/SiteHeader.tsx`

- Added role badges next to user name in header
- Color-coded badges:
  - **Admin:** Green/Success badge
  - **Artist:** Blue/Info badge
  - **Buyer:** Neutral/Gray badge
- Makes user's current role immediately visible

### 3. Enhanced Profile Page
**File:** `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`

- Added role badge with color coding
- Added role descriptions explaining access levels:
  - **Admin:** "Full access to admin console and moderation tools"
  - **Artist:** "Can create and manage artwork listings"
  - **Buyer:** "Can purchase artworks and view certificates"
- Provides clear understanding of account capabilities

### 4. Unauthorized Access Page
**File:** `src/pages/UnauthorizedPage.tsx` (NEW)

- Created dedicated unauthorized access page
- Shows clear error message when user lacks required role
- Displays current user role
- Lists access requirements for each role type
- Provides navigation options (Go Back, Return to Gallery)

**UX Flow:**
1. User tries to access restricted page
2. If authenticated but lacks role → Redirected to `/unauthorized`
3. If not authenticated → Redirected to `/login`

### 5. Improved ProtectedRoute Component
**File:** `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

- Enhanced logic to differentiate between:
  - **Not authenticated:** Redirect to login
  - **Authenticated but wrong role:** Redirect to unauthorized page
- Provides better UX by showing appropriate error message

### 6. Updated Routing
**File:** `src/App.tsx`

- Added `/unauthorized` route for unauthorized access page
- Maintains existing role-based route protection

## User Experience Improvements

### For Buyers
- Clean interface showing only gallery and purchase options
- No confusing links to artist or admin areas
- Clear indication of buyer status in header

### For Artists
- Access to artist dashboard prominently displayed
- Role badge shows artist status
- Profile explains artwork creation capabilities

### For Admins
- Full navigation access visible
- Green success badge for admin status
- Profile highlights administrative privileges

## Visual Design

### Role Badge Colors
- **Admin:** `tone="success"` - Green/mint color scheme
- **Artist:** `tone="info"` - Blue/sky color scheme  
- **Buyer:** `tone="neutral"` - Gray/stone color scheme

### Consistency
- Role badges used consistently across:
  - Site header
  - Profile page
  - All follow same color-coding scheme

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Test as Buyer:**
   - Login as buyer account
   - Verify only "Browse" appears in Sidebar
   - Try accessing `/artists` → Should redirect to `/unauthorized`
   - Try accessing `/admin` → Should redirect to `/unauthorized`
   - Verify buyer badge appears in header

2. **Test as Artist:**
   - Login as artist account
   - Verify "Browse" and "Artists" appear in Sidebar
   - Access should work for `/artists`
   - Try accessing `/admin` → Should redirect to `/unauthorized`
   - Verify artist badge appears in header

3. **Test as Admin:**
   - Login as admin account
   - Verify all navigation links visible
   - Should access all routes successfully
   - Verify admin badge appears in header

4. **Test Unauthorized Page:**
   - As buyer, manually navigate to `/artists`
   - Should see unauthorized page with clear message
   - "Go Back" button should work
   - "Return to Gallery" button should work

## Security Notes

- UI/UX changes are **presentational only**
- Backend RBAC enforcement remains primary security layer
- Frontend role-based navigation improves UX but doesn't replace server-side checks
- All API endpoints still enforce role restrictions via `RolesGuard`

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Add role transition flows (e.g., buyer upgrading to artist)
2. Add tooltips on locked/restricted features
3. Add role-specific dashboards with quick stats
4. Add notification system for role-based announcements
5. Add admin impersonation feature for debugging
