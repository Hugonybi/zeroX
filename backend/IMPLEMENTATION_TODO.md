### Setup Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env

## üìù Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **NestJS**: Chosen for enterprise-grade structure and TypeScript support
- **Prisma**: Selected for type-safe database operations and migrations
- **Bull**: Used for reliable background job processing
- **Paystack**: Integrated for Nigerian market focus and fiat payments
- **Hedera**: Selected for eco-friendly NFTs and low transaction costs

### Integration Patterns
- **Queue-based Processing**: All NFT minting happens asynchronously
- **Webhook-driven Updates**: Payment status updates trigger minting jobs
- **IPFS Metadata Storage**: Ensures decentralized metadata persistence
- **JWT with Refresh**: Secure authentication with token rotation

### Future Considerations
- **Scaling**: Redis cluster and database sharding strategies
- **Multi-chain**: Potential expansion to other blockchain networks
- **International**: Multi-currency and regional payment processors
- **Mobile**: API design considers future mobile app development
