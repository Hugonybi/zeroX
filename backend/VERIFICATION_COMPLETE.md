## ✅ What's Configured

### Environment Variables
```bash
HEDERA_NFT_TOKEN_ID="[your authenticity token]"
HEDERA_OWNERSHIP_TOKEN_ID="0.0.7141105"  # ← NEW!
```

### Database
- ✅ `ownership_tokens` table created
- ✅ Relationships linked
- ✅ Migrations applied

### Backend
- ✅ TokenizationModule registered
- ✅ Dual minting worker active
- ✅ API endpoints available
- ✅ Build successful

---

## 🧪 Test the Implementation

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### 2. Make a Test Purchase
As a buyer:
1. Browse artworks
2. Complete checkout (fiat payment)
3. Wait for mint job to complete (~5-10 seconds)

### 3. Verify Both Tokens Were Minted
```bash
# Check order status
GET /orders/{orderId}
# Should show: orderStatus: "fulfilled"

# Get dual certificate
GET /ownership/order/{orderId}
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "authenticityToken": {
    "hederaTokenId": "0.0.xxxxx/1",
    "hashscanUrl": "https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.xxxxx"
  },
  "ownershipToken": {
    "hederaTokenId": "0.0.7141105/1",
    "hashscanUrl": "https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.7141105",
    "transferable": true,
    "fractions": 1
  }
}
```

### 4. Verify on Hedera Explorer
Visit both Hashscan URLs to see:
- ✅ NFT metadata
- ✅ Serial numbers
- ✅ Ownership (treasury account)
- ✅ Token properties

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Minting Fails

**Check order status:**
```sql
SELECT id, orderStatus FROM orders WHERE id = 'order-uuid';
```

Possible statuses:
- `mint_failed` → Authenticity token failed
- `ownership_mint_failed` → Ownership token failed (authenticity succeeded)
- `fulfilled` → Both succeeded ✅

**Re-mint ownership token (admin):**
```bash
POST /ownership/admin/re-mint
{
  "orderId": "order-uuid"
}
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# Worker logs
tail -f logs/mint-worker.log

# Look for:
# ✓ Authenticity token minted: 0.0.xxxxx/1
# ✓ Ownership token minted: 0.0.7141105/1
```

## 📊 Cost Tracking

Each artwork sale now costs:
- Authenticity NFT: ~$0.001 USD
- Ownership NFT: ~$0.001 USD
- **Total: ~$0.002 USD**

Monitor your HBAR balance:
```bash
# Check testnet balance
curl -X GET "https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Frontend Updates ⏳
Update UI to show both certificates (see `FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md`)

### Phase 2: Wallet Integration 🔮
- Add "Connect Wallet" button
- Implement token transfer to buyer
- Unfreeze ownership token

### Phase 3: Secondary Market 🚀
- Build listing/auction system
- Enable token transfers between users
- Track provenance on-chain
