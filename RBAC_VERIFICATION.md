# RBAC Implementation Verification

## Changes Made

### Controllers Updated
1. **artworks.controller.ts**
   - Added `RolesGuard` to artist-only endpoints
   - Endpoints affected:
     - `POST /artist/artworks` - Create artwork (artist only)
     - `PATCH /artist/artworks/:id` - Update artwork (artist only)

2. **orders.controller.ts**
   - Added `RolesGuard` to buyer-only endpoints
   - Endpoints affected:
     - `POST /checkout` - Create checkout (buyer only)

3. **users.controller.ts**
   - Added `RolesGuard` to admin-only endpoints
   - Endpoints affected:
     - `GET /users/:id` - Get user by ID (admin only)
     - `PATCH /users/:id` - Update user (admin or artist)

## How to Verify

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Artist Role Protection**
   ```bash
   # Try to create artwork as buyer - should fail with 403
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/artist/artworks \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <buyer_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "Test Art", ...}'
   
   # Try to create artwork as artist - should succeed
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/artist/artworks \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <artist_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "Test Art", ...}'
   ```

2. **Test Buyer Role Protection**
   ```bash
   # Try to checkout as artist - should fail with 403
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/checkout \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <artist_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"artworkId": "...", ...}'
   
   # Try to checkout as buyer - should succeed
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/checkout \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <buyer_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"artworkId": "...", ...}'
   ```

3. **Test Admin Role Protection**
   ```bash
   # Try to get user as buyer - should fail with 403
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/users/<user_id> \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <buyer_token>"
   
   # Try to get user as admin - should succeed
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/users/<user_id> \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>"
   ```

### Expected Responses

- **403 Forbidden**: When user doesn't have required role
  ```json
  {
    "statusCode": 403,
    "message": "Insufficient permissions",
    "error": "Forbidden"
  }
  ```

- **200 OK / 201 Created**: When user has required role and request is valid

## Test Coverage

A unit test file has been created at `backend/test/rbac.spec.ts` that verifies:
- ✅ Access allowed when no roles required
- ✅ Access allowed when user has required role
- ✅ Access allowed when user has one of multiple required roles
- ✅ Access denied when user doesn't have required role
- ✅ Access denied when user is not authenticated
- ✅ Buyer cannot access artist endpoints
- ✅ Artist cannot access admin endpoints

## Security Impact

This implementation closes a security gap where role restrictions were declared but not enforced. Before this change:
- Any authenticated user could create/update artworks (artist endpoints)
- Any authenticated user could access admin functions
- Role decorators were present but had no effect

After this change:
- ✅ Only artists can create/update artworks
- ✅ Only buyers can create checkouts
- ✅ Only admins can access user management endpoints
- ✅ Role-based access control is properly enforced
