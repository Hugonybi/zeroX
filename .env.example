# Azure Blob Storage (for artwork uploads)
# Generate SAS token in Azure Portal:
# 1. Go to Storage Account → Containers → artwork → Shared access tokens
# 2. Set permissions to: Read, Add, Create, Write (racw) - NOT just Read (r)!
# 3. Set expiry date (e.g., 1-7 days for dev)
# 4. Generate SAS token and URL
# 5. Copy the FULL URL including the "?sp=racw&st=..." query string
# 
# Example: https://youraccount.blob.core.windows.net/artwork?sp=racw&st=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&se=2025-01-08T00:00:00Z&...
#
# Note: If you see "403 not authorized" errors, your SAS token likely only has 'sp=r' (read).
# You need 'sp=racw' (read, add, create, write) for uploads to work.
#
# CORS Configuration (optional for localhost uploads):
# - In Azure Portal → Storage Account → Settings → Resource sharing (CORS)
# - Add Blob service rule: Allowed origins: http://localhost:5174
# - Allowed methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS
# - Allowed headers: *
# - Exposed headers: *
# - Max age: 3600
